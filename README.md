# fruit-classifier-app

This project uses a trained model to classify images into different categories.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Model Training
The model was trained on a dataset of images of various fruits in different states. The dataset was split into a training set and a validation set. The model was trained using the training set and the performance was evaluated using the validation set.

## Usage
To use the image classifier, run the following command:

python classifier.py

Replace the image path in the classifier.py file with the path to your image.

# Model
The model was trained on a dataset of images. The labels for the images are stored in labels.txt.

# Streamlit App
There is also a streamlit app that allows you to upload an image and get a prediction. To run the app, use the following command:

streamlit run app.py

In the app, you can upload an image of a fruit(orange, banana, apple) and the app will display the predicted state of the fruit.
